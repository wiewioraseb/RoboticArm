# RoboticArm
2D robotic arm simulator with simple inverse kinematics functionality for 2 joints (2 degrees of freedom). 

#To do:
*  Slider changes value simultaneously with arms changing possition when inverse kinematics are used (mouse click/drag)
*  180 degree restriction for arms movement when mouse clicked/dragged

For XML files I used JDOM library:
